The Mandelbrot set has become an ambassador for the beauty of mathematics. Its hypnotic, infinitely complex structure has astounded mathematicians and non-mathematicians alike and has been a subject of mathematical research for decades. Interested in the structure and behaviour of the Mandelbrot set, I used Python to animate zooms into this captivating fractal.

### Formal Definition
First, for every \\(c\in\mathbb{C}\\) we associate the function \\( f: \\mathbb{C}\\to\\mathbb{C},\\;z\\mapsto z^2 + c \\).

{% raw %}
\\[ f_c(z) = z^2 + c \\]
{% endraw %}
