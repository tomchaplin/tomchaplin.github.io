Path homology is a topological invariant for directed graphs, which is sensitive to their asymmetry and can discern between digraphs which are indistinguishable to the directed flag complex.
In Erdös-Rényi directed random graphs, the first Betti number undergoes two distinct transitions, appearing at a low-density boundary and vanishing again at a high-density boundary.
In this video, I briefly describe techniques for studying these transitions, with more details on the [arXiv pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13493).
