Hi, I'm a third year mathematics student from the UK with a keen interest in programming. This website is intended to host a number of my personal projects that I've completed over recent years. These projects will cover a wide range of topics but most will include some sort of programming or mathematics aspect. [View my portfolio here](/portfolio).

I first started programming, using basic Lua scripts to automate tasks in Minecraft with the mod ComputerCraft. This was a great introduction to the craft and was motivated entirely through practical projects, an approach I still use to this day. After years of playing with this mod I eventually started using object-oriented programming to create more reusable code, such as creating GUIs on in-game touch screen displays.

During my A-levels and moving into univeristy, this prior programming experience became an invaluable tool for visualising mathematics and simulating statistical problems. Alongside my study, I continued exploring personal programming projects such as control systems in Kerbal Space Program and animating zooms into the Mandelbrot set. Programming has continually provided a practical aplication of the problem solving skills I've gained through my degree.
