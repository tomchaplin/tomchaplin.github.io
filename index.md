Hi, I'm a third year mathematics student from the UK with a keen interest in programming. This website is intended to host a number of my personal projects that I've completed over recent years. These projects will cover a wide range of topics but most will include some sort of programming or mathematics aspect.

Talking points:

* How I got into programming
* Problem solving (maths -> software)
* What I program for:
    - Practical projects
    - Physics problems
    - visulaising maths
* Areas of interest (maths)
    - Topology
    - Control Theory
    - Fractal Geometry
    - Non-Euclidean Geometry
    - Parallel Computing?
